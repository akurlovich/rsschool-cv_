####About me:
I want to **radically change my workplace**. I have successfully completed an ***internship*** and the *“Software Testing”* and *“Software Testing. Professional level”* courses of BELHARD Academy. My teaсher thinks I have good knowledge in Software Testing, SDLS and STLC,  so I can develop plans and procedures for testing, preparing test documentation using TestRail and tracking defects in JIRA.  

My english level is intermediate (maybe, but I'm not sure, upper- intermediate). 

At my current job position, I face every day with different tasks from customers and suppliers also from co-workers of other departments, so I can tell that I am good at  ***teamwork*** and ***problem solving***.
